**Welcome to Spoticord**
Looks like you could use some help! Lets go over the basics!

**What is Spoticord?**
Spoticord is a Discord music bot that acts like a Spotify speaker.

_What does that mean?_
Well think of it as being together with a group of friends, and playing some music over a bluetooth speaker.
That is what Spoticord does, but instead of being a bluetooth speaker, it's a Discord bot!

**Do I need Spotify Premium?**
**_Yes_**, Spotify Premium is required for this bot to work.
This is a limitation set by Spotify, and even if this wasn't the case Spoticord still wouldn't allow free users.
This is because Spoticord does not support Spotify Free "features" (ads, limited skips, etc).

**How to use the bot**
**[Click here](https://spoticord.com/#how-to)** for a quick overview about how to set up Spoticord, and some basic usage tips.

**What commands can I use?**
For a list of commands, you can check out [the commands section](https://spoticord.com/#commands) on the website.
You can also just type `/` in a text chat and Discord will automatically show you all available commands.
